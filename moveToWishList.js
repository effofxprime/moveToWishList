/*
Usage:
	1. Edit the wishListID variable to the ID of your wishlist that you wish to use (heh, pun).
			+ Can be found by first clicking on "Add to list", then Inspecting (Ctrl + Shift + C for firefox), Ctrl + F search for "cldd-add-item-declarative" then finding the right one which highlights the wishlist you want to use.
			(Search up "Inspect keybind for X browser", replacing X with your browser name if you are not using firefox)
	2. Edit yesDelete variable to your liking (0 = do not delete items, 1 = delete items).
	3. Paste entire script into browser console. (Ctrl + Shift + K on firefox, again, search for this keybind for your browser if not firefox)
	4. Press ENTER key.
	5. Sit back and watch, or get a Coffee, or both ... or neither!

Timing Issues:
	Edit the number in every "setTimeout" command, in miliseconds, to whatever works for you.
		(Note; if possible, in future iterations a variable with the delay timer could be used. For now, each command would need editing.)
		Each timer is in miliseconds, longer page loading will need you to increase this. Default delays *should* be ok.
		
Possible future versions could include:
	* A second timing option (Timer for executing the second action after the first, then another timer for the delay before starting the first action again for the next item.)
	* Fix retry if wishList hadn't loaded yet.
